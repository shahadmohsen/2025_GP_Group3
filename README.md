## Introduction  
Taif is a project designed to provide comprehensive support for families with children on the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The platform addresses key challenges such as delayed diagnoses, lack of awareness, and difficulty in accessing appropriate resources.

- An organized calendar system to manage appointments and schedules efficiently.  
- Chatbot for educational tips.
